# League Pinging Service

## Does what it says - Pings league of legends garena server (lol.garena.com) and displays the ping continuously in with colors

Ping colors vary according to how high or low it is. <span style="color:green">Green is good</span>,<span style="color:red"> Red is bad</span>.

Additionally also displays ping to the local gateway router. Helps determine whether a lag, if any, is due to the internet or due to the unstable wifi connection that you are using ;)
